# Problem with John

Default installation of `john` always fail:

```
┌──(known㉿DESKTOP-DTPC4J5)-[~]
└─$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt sshash 
[SSH] cipher value of 6 is not supported!
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
No password hashes loaded (see FAQ)
```

# Build John from source

First, clone john

$ `git clone -depth 1 https://github.com/openwall/john.git`

## Configuring
In `john/src`:

$ `./configure`

If you get an error here, look below.

Last few lines of output:
```
Configured for building John the Ripper jumbo:

Target CPU ................................. x86_64 AVX2, 64-bit LE
AES-NI support ............................. depends on OpenSSL
Target OS .................................. linux-gnu
Cross compiling ............................ no
Legacy arch header ......................... x86-64.h

Optional libraries/features found:
Memory map (share/page large files) ........ yes
Fork support ............................... yes
OpenMP support ............................. yes (not for fast formats)
OpenCL support ............................. no
Generic crypt(3) format .................... yes
libgmp (PRINCE mode and faster SRP formats)  no
128-bit integer (faster PRINCE mode) ....... yes
libz (pkzip and some other formats) ........ no
libbz2 (gpg2john extra decompression logic)  no
libpcap (vncpcap2john and SIPdump) ......... no
OpenMPI support (default disabled) ......... no
ZTEX USB-FPGA module 1.15y support ......... no

Install missing libraries to get any needed features that were omitted.

Configure finished.  Now "make -s clean && make -sj4" to compile.
```

## Some errors

### No C compiler

Most people should ignore this step, since they have a c compiler installed already. I don't have one.

$ `sudo apt-get install clang`

### Missing OpenSSL header

I don't have OpenSSL header. This is needed. Install.

For Debian: 
$ `sudo apt install libssl-dev`

For Mac:
$ `brew upgrade openssl`


# Install

***Make sure you have `./configure`'d successfully before you do this***

Now install. This will take a while.

```
